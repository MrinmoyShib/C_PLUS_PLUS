# 🚀 C++ Programming Journey

A comprehensive repository documenting my evolution as a C++ developer. This space tracks my progress from understanding memory management to mastering the Standard Template Library (STL).

---

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to my personal C++ sanctuary! This repository is a living document of my growth. I believe that deep-diving into C++ is the foundation for understanding how software truly interacts with hardware.

## 🏗️ What’s Inside?

* **📈 Learning Progress:** Step-by-step logic files covering core language features.
* **🎮 Projects:** Small-scale applications (Calculators, Games, File Parsers).
* **🧩 Practice Code:** Solutions to daily challenges and syntax drills.
* **📦 STL Mastery:** Dedicated folder for understanding C++ Container classes.
* **📝 Notes:** Deep dives into "Gotchas," debugging tips, and performance tweaks.

## 📦 STL Container Progress Tracking

Tracking my familiarity with the most powerful part of C++:

- [x] **Vectors:** Dynamic Arrays & Memory Reallocation.
- [x] **Strings:** Manipulation and specialized methods.
- [ ] **Maps/Sets:** Balanced Trees and Key-Value logic.
- [ ] **Stacks/Queues:** Implementing LIFO and FIFO.
- [ ] **Algorithms:** Using `std::sort`, `std::find`, and `std::accumulate`.
